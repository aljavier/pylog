                    <h3>What is a hacker?</h3>
<p>The Jargon File contains a bunch of definitions of the term ‘hacker’, 
most having to do with technical adeptness and a delight in solving
problems and overcoming limits. If you want to know how to become a 
hacker, though, only two are really relevant.</p>
<p><img alt="Hacker" src="images/hacker_emblem.png" /></p>
<p>There is a community, a shared culture, of expert programmers and 
networking wizards that traces its history back through decades to 
the first time-sharing minicomputers and the earliest ARPAnet 
experiments. The members of this culture originated the term ‘hacker’. 
Hackers built the Internet. Hackers made the Unix operating system 
what it is today. Hackers make the World Wide Web work. If you are 
part of this culture, if you have contributed to it and other people 
in it know who you are and call you a hacker, you're a hacker.</p>
<p>The hacker mind-set is not confined to this software-hacker culture. 
There are people who apply the hacker attitude to other things, like 
electronics or music — actually, you can find it at the highest 
levels of any science or art. Software hackers recognize these 
kindred spirits elsewhere and may call them ‘hackers’ too — and 
some claim that the hacker nature is really independent of the 
particular medium the hacker works in. But in the rest of this 
document we will focus on the skills and attitudes of software hackers, 
and the traditions of the shared culture that originated the term 
‘hacker’.</p>
<p>There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers, 
but aren't. These are people (mainly adolescent males) who get a kick 
out of breaking into computers and phreaking the phone system. 
Real hackers call these people ‘crackers’ and want nothing to do with them.
Real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy, irresponsible, and not 
very bright, and object that being able to break security doesn't 
make you a hacker any more than being able to hotwire cars makes you 
an automotive engineer. Unfortunately, many journalists and writers 
have been fooled into using the word ‘hacker’ to describe crackers; 
this irritates real hackers no end.</p>
<p>The basic difference is this: hackers build things, crackers break 
them.</p>
<p>If you want to be a hacker, keep reading. If you want to be a cracker,
go read the alt.2600 newsgroup and get ready to do five to ten in the 
slammer after finding out you aren't as smart as you think you are. 
And that's all I'm going to say about crackers.</p>
